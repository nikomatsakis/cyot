# The `tango.stamp` file is automatically generated by tango.

# It is not inherently wrong to check it in (though I do worry about
# how the timestamps will be set after an initial clone), but it is
# better to instead try to ensure that you are consistent in whether
# you check in your `.md` files or your `.rs` files.

# If you do the latter, then definitely no reason to check it in.
